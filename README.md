# Chess
A Github Repository for a text based chess game application

## Board class
The board class will be using a decorator pattern, starting with the `base` class being the base Component and the `Tile` class being the sole major ConcreteComponent of the pattern. While the `Board` class will be the base decorator and for this project, at the present moment, we will have one ConcreteDecorator class `ChessBoard`.
